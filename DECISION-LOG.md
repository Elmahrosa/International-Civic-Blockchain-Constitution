# DECISION-LOG.md  
## TEOS Sovereign Stack — Decision Log (v1.0)

**Repository:** International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
**Purpose:** Record founder-level architectural and governance decisions.  
**Rule:** No silent changes. Any change to a locked decision must be logged here.

---

## 2026-01 — Constitutional Governance & Authority

- [LOCKED] International Civic Blockchain Constitution is the sole canonical source of authority.
  - Rationale: Prevent governance drift and ensure sovereign legitimacy.

- [LOCKED] No code, API, AI, or partnership may operate outside the sovereign authority chain.
  - Rationale: Enforces constitutional supremacy over technical execution.

- [LOCKED] Authority Chain finalized as:
  Constitution → TEOS-FORGE → TEOS-Governance → TEOS-Compliance-Kit (Country Profile)
  → TEOS-AI-Guard → TEOS-AI-Auditor → Teos-Sovereign-System → TEOS-API-Sovereign
  → External Apps / Nations / Partners
  - Rationale: Establishes non-negotiable order of control and accountability.

## 2026-01 — Rights Model & Market Positioning

- [LOCKED] TEOS sells sovereign usage rights, not equity and not project ownership.
  - Rationale: Prevents equity interpretation and preserves founder sovereignty.

- [LOCKED] Founder retains 100% sovereign/constitutional control (final authority).
  - Rationale: Sovereignty must remain structurally intact.

- [LOCKED] Rights are presented as “Rights Capacity / Access Caps”, not “Allocation %”.
  - Rationale: Avoids ownership framing; improves institutional defensibility.

- [LOCKED] Visual strategy: equal donut slices preferred to avoid equity-like inference.
  - Rationale: Minimizes misinterpretation during institutional review.

- [GUIDANCE] Do not publish fixed numbers; use non-binding indicative ranges with caps.
  - Rationale: Maintains honesty and negotiation flexibility.

---

## 2026-01 — Access Classes (Indicative Ranges)

- [GUIDANCE] Founding Nations:
  Access Cap up to 20% (collective) | USD 3M–8M per nation | bilateral sovereign agreement.
  - Rationale: Conservative entry range for early sovereign adopters.

- [GUIDANCE] Institutions:
  Access Cap up to 10% (collective) | USD 1M–3M per institution | licensed deployment.
  - Rationale: Institutional ticket-size realism.

- [GUIDANCE] Regional Alliances:
  Access Cap up to 25% (collective) | USD 7.5M–20M per hub | multi-nation coordination.
  - Rationale: Higher value justified only at regional coordination layer.

- [LOCKED] Tokenized Infrastructure:
  Variable access | asset-backed issuance only | no speculative minting.
  - Rationale: Ties tokenization to real assets; avoids speculative risk.

- [LOCKED] Unallocated capacity remains dormant by default.
  - Rationale: Preserves sovereignty and prevents artificial “availability”.

---

## 2026-01 — Globalization & National Localization

- [LOCKED] Globalization occurs via National Adapter Layer (Country Profiles), not centralization.
  - Rationale: Each nation retains its law/constitution without breaking the chain.

- [LOCKED] TEOS-Compliance-Kit is designed to be localized per jurisdiction.
  - Rationale: Compliance is national by nature; the framework must adapt.

---

## 2026-01 — Licensing & Legal Consistency

- [LOCKED] TESL is the governing license across the sovereign stack.
  - Rationale: Single legal anchor for rights, enforcement, and adoption.

- [GUIDANCE] Every repo must include consistent LICENSE/NOTICE pointers to the canonical source.
  - Rationale: Prevents institutional confusion and legal inconsistency.

---

## 2026-01 — Institutional Track (Gov / UN / IFIs)

- [LOCKED] Launch an institutional RFP track as primary adoption channel.
  - Rationale: Sovereign adoption is document-driven, not hype-driven.

- [LOCKED] Create and maintain:
  rfp/GOVERNMENT_OVERVIEW.md as the first sovereign-facing sales document.
  - Rationale: Establishes formal procurement posture.

- [GUIDANCE] Build UN/IFI compatibility documentation:
  rfp/UN_SDG_IMPLEMENTATION.md aligned with SDG 16.9 and SDG 17.17 and DPI/GovStack principles.
  - Rationale: Enables funding readiness.

---

## 2026-01 — Engagement Strategy

- [LOCKED] Engagement is online-first; travel only after alignment and invitation.
  - Rationale: Conserves resources; matches institutional process.

- [LOCKED] Documentation precedes meetings.
  - Rationale: Institutions require written clarity before calls.

---

## Open Items (Not Decided)

- [OPEN] First adopting jurisdiction / first national partner.
- [OPEN] Legal wrapper per country (implementation structure).
- [OPEN] Exact timelines for rollout per region.
- [OPEN] Minimum viable demo scope for sovereign review.

---

## Change Control

- [LOCKED] Any change to a LOCKED decision requires:
  (1) explicit founder decision,
  (2) an entry in this log,
  (3) update to SOVEREIGN-NOTES.md if applicable.
