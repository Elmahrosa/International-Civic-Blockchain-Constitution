## 📜 Executive Summary
The **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)** is the supreme governance charter of the TEOS ecosystem. It establishes the legal and operational framework for **Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**. 

Unlike traditional permissionless protocols, the ICBC anchors digital execution in **human institutional authority**. It ensures that every automated action—whether by AI or smart logic—remains traceable, auditable, and subservient to national law and international standards.

---

## 💎 Institutional Pillars
To ensure "Justice-Ready" infrastructure, the ICBC enforces five non-negotiable pillars:

1. **Digital Sovereignty** Authority resides in lawful human institutions. No algorithm, AI agent, or decentralized protocol can originate sovereign power.
2. **Policy-Before-Execution** Systems exist only to enforce pre-authorized human policy. Technical execution never creates new authority.
3. **Forensic Auditability** Every governance event is cryptographically hashed and logged, creating a "Root of Trust" that is admissible in legal proceedings.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop AI** Automated systems are strictly decision-support tools. Final authorization for high-impact actions requires verified human credentials.
5. **Jurisdictional Interoperability** Engineered to align with **Egypt’s Law 194/2020** and global standards (GDPR, GovStack), ensuring a safe path for public-sector adoption.

---

## 🏗️ The Chain of Authority (Non-Bypassable)
TEOS architecture follows a strictly downward flow of legitimacy. No system or API may operate outside this hierarchy:

1. **The ICBC (This Constitution)** → The Supreme Root of Trust.
2. **TEOS-FORGE** → The DPI Factory & Integration Layer.
3. **Executable Governance** → Logic that enforces the Charter.
4. **AI-Guard & Auditor** → Continuous compliance oversight.
5. **Sovereign Execution Kernel** → Low-level system operations.

## 📂 Repository Architecture
This repository serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for the stack's legitimacy:

* **`CONSTITUTION.md`**: The machine-readable and human-verifiable binding charter.
* **`LICENSE.md`**: The **TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL)**—defining the rights for state and institutional use.
* **`REPO_LOCK.md`**: The cryptographic hash registry ensuring the immutability of the governance core.
* **`annexes/`**: Technical schedules for National Identity (DID) and Data Exchange standards.

---

## ⚖️ Licensing: TESL Sovereign
All components of the TEOS stack are governed by the **TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL)**. 

* **Audit Rights:** Fully open for regulatory and institutional review.
* **Sovereignty Protection:** Prohibits unauthorized forks that claim sovereign legitimacy.
* **Commercial Use:** Restricted to authorized partners to ensure public-interest alignment.

---

## 🎯 Target Adoption
The ICBC is designed for:
* **National Governments** seeking vendor-independent Digital Identity.
* **Intergovernmental Organizations (IFIs)** requiring auditable grant and data flows.
* **Central Banks** evaluating secure, policy-governed infrastructure.
* **Smart City Authorities** implementing auditable civic services.
