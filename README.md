# 📜 Teos International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)

**The Supreme Legal and Governance Charter of the TEOS Sovereign Stack**

---

## Executive Summary

The **Teos International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)** is the supreme governing document of the TEOS ecosystem.  
It establishes a **sovereign, civic-first constitutional framework** for the design, deployment, and regulation of digital public infrastructure (DPI), blockchain-based governance systems, and accountable digital economies.

The ICBC functions as **law**, not code.  
No protocol, smart contract, AI system, or execution layer may operate outside the authority defined in this Constitution.

---

## Constitutional Purpose

The Constitution defines:

- The legal foundation of digital civic participation  
- The authority hierarchy governing all TEOS systems  
- The rights and obligations of digital citizens and institutions  
- The boundaries between human authority, automated systems, and artificial intelligence  
- The rules for governance, compliance, dispute resolution, and constitutional amendment  

It is designed for **national, institutional, and international adoption**, aligning with public-sector governance standards.

---

## Core Constitutional Principles

The ICBC is built upon four immutable pillars:

### 1. Sovereignty
Human and institutional authority supersede automated systems.  
Code executes law — it does not create it.

### 2. Transparency
All governance actions, policy decisions, and constitutional amendments must be publicly auditable and permanently recorded.

### 3. Civic Responsibility
Digital rights are inseparable from civic obligations, ethical conduct, and institutional accountability.

### 4. Interoperability
The framework is designed to interoperate with national legal systems, international organizations, and multilateral governance standards.

## Key Articles of Governance

### Article I — Digital Citizenship & Identity  
Defines eligibility, rights, and responsibilities of digital citizens, while enforcing privacy, data sovereignty, and anti-Sybil protections.

### Article II — Governance & Decision-Making  
Establishes the lawful process for proposing, debating, ratifying, and enforcing policy and constitutional decisions.

### Article III — Treasury & Economic Governance  
Mandates transparent, auditable management of public digital assets and community funds.

### Article IV — Judicial & Dispute Resolution  
Creates a civic dispute resolution framework combining smart-contract enforcement with human adjudication when required.

### Article V — Constitutional Amendment  
Defines a strict, super-majority-based process for constitutional change, preserving stability while allowing evolution.

## Authority Hierarchy

All systems governed by TEOS must follow this **non-bypassable authority chain**:

```text
International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)
        ↓
Governance Stewardship (TEOS-FORGE)
        ↓
Policy & Governance Systems
        ↓
Compliance & Audit Layers
        ↓
Execution Systems (Sovereign Kernels, APIs, Services)
````

Any system operating outside this hierarchy is **unauthorized and non-compliant**.
