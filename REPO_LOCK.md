# 🔒 REPO_LOCK — Canonical Hash Registry & Repository Lock

**Repository:** Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
**Maintainer / Constitutional Authority:** Elmahrosa International  
**Jurisdiction & Governing Law:** Arab Republic of Egypt  
**Status:** 🔴 **IMMUTABLE ROOT — CONSTITUTIONALLY LOCKED**

## 1. Purpose & Legal Effect

This document establishes the **Repository Lock** and **Canonical Hash Registry**
for the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**.

It has **binding constitutional force**.

From the moment this file is committed:

- This repository becomes the **immutable root of authority**
- This repository is the **sole canonical source** of the ICBC
- Any unauthorized change is **null, void, and without legal or technical effect**

This file is **operative constitutional law**, not documentation.

---

## 2. Constitutional Supremacy

The ICBC is the **highest authority** in the TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack.

Authority flows strictly downward:

```

ICBC (This Repository)
↓
TEOS Governance
↓
Execution Systems
↓
Applications & Deployments

```

No repository, automation, maintainer, or fork may override this authority.

---

## 3. Immutable Root Declaration

This repository is hereby declared:

- 🔒 **Constitutionally Locked**
- 🧱 **Non-Forkable for Authority**
- ⚖️ **Legally and Cryptographically Binding**

Forks may exist for reference **only**.  
Forks **do not** carry constitutional authority.

---

## 4. Canonical Files (Root of Trust)

The following files constitute the **constitutional root set**.
Their contents and hashes define the ICBC.

| File Path | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | Canonical |
| `REPO_LOCK.md` | Canonical |
| `docs/AUTHORITY-CHAIN.md` | Canonical |
| `annexes/` | Canonical |
| `articles/` | Canonical |

Any file not listed above has **no constitutional standing**.

---

## 5. Canonical Hash Registry (Authoritative)

The following cryptographic hashes are **legally and constitutionally binding**.
Any discrepancy between content and hash renders the file **non-canonical and invalid**.

### 🔐 Registered Hashes

```

File Path : docs/AUTHORITY-CHAIN.md
Algorithm : SHA256
Hash      : 571592D856DCC51999B3A766EB4CE1992C7921890376B9B963FCE43BCA13449E

```

> This hash is final.  
> It MUST NOT be recalculated, replaced, or altered outside a lawful amendment process.

---

## 6. Amendment Rules (Absolute)

Amendments to the ICBC are permitted **only** if ALL conditions are met:

1. Explicit constitutional procedure is followed  
2. Amendment is approved by the recognized constitutional authority  
3. New hashes are generated and recorded in this Registry  
4. The Repository Lock is reaffirmed  

Any change outside this process is **constitutionally void**.

---

## 7. Enforcement Clause

- Automation MAY enforce the Constitution  
- Automation MAY NOT modify the Constitution  
- Execution NEVER creates authority  

> **Law governs code.**  
> **Authority governs execution.**

---

## 8. Final Declaration

By committing this file, Elmahrosa International formally declares:

- This repository is the **immutable constitutional root**
- This lock is **intentional, permanent, and enforceable**
- No future claim may override this declaration without lawful amendment
