# 🔗 TEOS Sovereign Authority Chain
## Canonical Authority & Execution Hierarchy

This document defines the **non-negotiable authority and execution hierarchy**
governing the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It applies to **all repositories, systems, APIs, AI modules, integrations, and deployments**
without exception.

This hierarchy is governed exclusively by the
**International Civic Blockchain Constitution** and enforced under the **TESL** license.

## 🏛️ Canonical Authority Flow

No system, component, or actor may operate outside the following authority chain:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution
↓
TEOS-FORGE
(Stewardship & Lifecycle Governance)
↓
TEOS-Governance
(Policy, Oversight & Decision Authority)
↓
TEOS-Compliance-Kit
(Jurisdictional & Regulatory Enforcement)
↓
TEOS-AI-Guard

↓
Teos-Sovereign-System
(Sovereign Execution Kernel)

```

Any deviation, bypass, or reordering of this chain is **strictly prohibited**.

## ⚖️ Authority Enforcement Rules

The following rules are absolute and non-negotiable:

- Authority **always flows downward**
- Execution **never creates authority**
- Governance **precedes automation**
- Compliance **must be validated before execution**
- AI **never decides**; it supports human authority only
- APIs **may not bypass governance or compliance layers**
- Audit evidence **must exist for every state-changing action**

Any system or integration violating these rules is considered
**non-compliant, unauthorized, and invalid**.

---

## 🛡️ AI & Automation Constraints

- AI components are **advisory only**
- No AI model may:
  - Issue binding decisions
  - Override governance rules
  - Execute actions without human authorization
- All AI activity must be:
  - Logged
  - Auditable
  - Traceable to an accountable authority

There is **no autonomous governance** within the TEOS Sovereign Stack.

---

## 🌍 Sovereign Scope of Application

This authority model is explicitly designed for:

- National governments
- Central banks
- Regulatory authorities
- National digital platforms
- UN / SDG-aligned Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) programs

This is **not**:
- A DAO governance model
- A community-voting system
- A permissionless protocol

Sovereignty is institutional, constitutional, and state-aligned by design.
