- **Nature:** Civic / Institutional  
- **Function:** Eligibility & Participation Signal  
- **Scope:** Sandboxed Constitutional Pilot

## 🔒 Why Trading, Minting, and Markets Are Disabled

To ensure institutional and regulatory acceptance (GovStack / IFIs), all
commercial capabilities have been permanently disabled:

### 1. No Speculation
- TEOS is **not a financial asset** and not a security.
- No price discovery and no market value.
- No liquidity on centralized or decentralized markets.

### 2. No Minting
- **Mint Authority** has been permanently **revoked** on Solana.
- Supply is **fixed and non-increasable**.

### 3. Market Disabled
- Solscan and Jupiter pages are **reference-only**.
- No active trading routes exist.

**Regulatory Rationale:**  
Government and institutional pilots prohibit speculative or volatile instruments.

## 🛠️ How TEOS Functions as a Constitutional Tool

TEOS is used exclusively as a **constitutional digital stamp** within the pilot
environment.

### 1. Eligibility Verification
- Participants hold TEOS in their wallet.
- Token possession is required to access pilot services
  (Identity, Data Exchange, Audit).
- The system verifies possession **without storing any personal data on-chain**.

### 2. Constitutional Participation
- TEOS serves as a **participation marker** (presence and engagement record).
- **TEOS confers no independent sovereign authority.**
- There is **no token-based governance**.
- All constitutional decisions are made solely by human and institutional
  authorities as defined in the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**.

### 3. Audit Logs
- Possession and participation events are recorded as **audit evidence**.
- This provides **evidence of agency and participation** without any financial effect.

## ⚙️ Revocation & Control Model

TEOS is designed with **constitutional control without technical confiscation**:

1. **Freeze Authority:**  
   - Revoked  
   - No on-chain freezing or seizure is possible

2. **Burn Protocol:**  
   - The constitutional authority may burn tokens under its custody if required
     by public policy

3. **Access Revocation (Off-chain):**
   - On-chain assets remain untouched
   - Access to the pilot can be revoked **off-chain**
   - Wallets retain the token but lose eligibility to participate

**Outcome:**  
Full institutional control without violating financial market rules or digital rights.
