# NOTICE TO GOVERNMENTS, CENTRAL BANKS & REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

## Binding Constitutional Authority Notice  
**TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**

This notice formally affirms that all engagements, pilots, deployments, integrations,
or evaluations involving **TEOS (The Elmahrosa Operating System)** are governed
exclusively by the **TEOS Sovereign Authority Chain**, as constitutionally defined
and cryptographically anchored above.

---

## 1. Canonical Authority Supremacy

All TEOS systems operate under a **single, non-negotiable authority hierarchy**:

International Civic Blockchain Constitution  
→ TEOS-FORGE (Stewardship & Lifecycle Governance)  
→ TEOS-Governance (Policy & Oversight Authority)  
→ TEOS-Compliance-Kit (Jurisdictional Enforcement)  
→ TEOS-AI-Guard (Advisory AI Safety Gates)  
→ TEOS-AI-Auditor (Audit & Evidence Layer)  
→ Teos-Sovereign-System (Execution Kernel)  
→ TEOS-API-Sovereign (Governed External Interfaces)

No authority exists outside this chain.

---

## 2. Legal & Institutional Effect

- **Execution does not create authority**
- **Automation does not override governance**
- **AI does not decide**
- **APIs do not bypass compliance**
- **All state-changing actions require auditable evidence**

Any system or institution operating outside this framework is
**non-compliant and unauthorized**.

---

## 3. Constitutional Capacity Governance

TEOS enforces a **hard constitutional ceiling**:

> **No geopolitical region may exceed 25% of total global sovereign access capacity**

This applies across pilots, production systems, funding vehicles,
and institutional intermediaries — without exception.

---

## 4. Scope of Applicability

This notice applies to:

- National governments  
- Central banks  
- Regulators & supervisory authorities  
- National digital platforms  
- UN / IFI / SDG-aligned DPI programs  

TEOS is **not** a DAO, **not** a permissionless protocol,
and **not** a community-voting system.

---

## 5. Acceptance by Engagement

Engagement with TEOS constitutes acknowledgment of this authority,
its constitutional supremacy, and its enforcement mechanisms.
