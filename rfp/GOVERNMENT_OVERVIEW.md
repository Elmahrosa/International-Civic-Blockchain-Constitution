## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the **TEOS Sovereign Stack** for governments, central banks, and public authorities evaluating **national Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** initiatives.

It is intended to support:
- Early-stage policy review
- Institutional alignment
- Procurement and RFP preparation

This document does **not** constitute a commercial offer, binding commitment, or transfer of ownership.

## 2. What TEOS Is (and Is Not)

### TEOS Is:
- A **sovereign software framework** for national digital infrastructure
- Constitutionally governed and law-aligned
- Deployable as a **single-country instance**
- Fully owned and operated by the adopting state

### TEOS Is Not:
- A vendor-controlled platform
- A centralized global network
- A data-extractive technology
- An equity or token sale mechanism

TEOS is designed to **serve governments**, not to replace them.

- Audit-ready identity records
- Compatible with civil registries and public services

### 3.2 Governance-First Architecture
- Human-readable rules precede automation
- Clear authority escalation
- No autonomous decision-making beyond mandate

### 3.3 National Compliance by Design

- No forced legal harmonization
- Constitutional compatibility preserved

### 3.4 Secure Interoperability
- Cross-border cooperation without data leakage
- Federation without centralization
- Standards-aligned integration

## 4. Constitutional Governance Model

All deployments operate under a fixed, auditable authority chain:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution
→ TEOS-FORGE
→ TEOS-Governance
→ TEOS-Compliance-Kit (Country Profile)
→ TEOS-AI-Guard
→ TEOS-AI-Auditor
→ Teos-Sovereign-System
→ TEOS-API-Sovereign
→ Government Systems & Authorized Partners

```

No component may bypass this chain.

## 5. Sovereign Rights & Legal Posture

- Governments receive **Sovereign Usage Rights**, not ownership transfers.
- No equity, IP, or constitutional authority is transferred.

All usage is governed by **TESL** and national law.
