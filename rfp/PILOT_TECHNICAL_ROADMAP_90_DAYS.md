# 🛠️ TEOS Sovereign Stack  
## Pilot Technical Roadmap — 90 Days

**Document Type:** Sovereign Pilot Execution Plan  
**Status:** Canonical | Non-Binding  
**Authority:** International Civic Blockchain Constitution  
**License:** TESL (Teos Ethical Sovereign License)  
**Audience:** Governments, Central Banks, UN Agencies, IFIs  

---

## 0. Purpose of the Pilot

The 90-day pilot validates **governance, compliance, and sovereignty**, not scale.

The objective is to demonstrate that a nation can:
- Operate digital infrastructure under its **own law**
- Maintain **full data sovereignty**
- Deploy DPI without vendor dependency
- Produce **audit-grade evidence** for funding and scale decisions

This pilot is **not** a public launch and **not** a production rollout.

---

## 1. Pilot Scope (Fixed)

### Included
- National Adapter Layer (NAL)
- Sovereign Digital Identity (limited cohort)
- Constitutional governance enforcement
- AI Guard & Auditor (non-autonomous)
- Audit and reporting outputs

### Excluded
- Mass enrollment
- Public-facing applications
- Token issuance or speculation
- Cross-border interoperability

---

## 2. Governance Preconditions (Day 0)

Before Day 1, the adopting authority must designate:

- **National Lead Authority** (Ministry / Central Bank / Regulator)
- **Legal Anchor** (constitutional or statutory mandate)
- **Technical Host** (on-premise / sovereign cloud)
- **Audit Counterparty** (state audit or IFI observer)

No technical work begins without this designation.

---

## 3. Phase I — Constitutional & Legal Adaptation (Days 1–30)

### Objectives
- Bind TEOS to national law
- Lock authority boundaries
- Configure compliance logic

### Deliverables
- National Adapter Layer (Country Profile)
- Compliance rule mapping
- Authority registry
- Legal review memo

### Activities
- Map national constitution, ID law, data protection law
- Configure NAL ruleset
- Validate non-conflict with existing systems
- Approve pilot legal scope

### Evidence Produced
- Signed authority designation
- Compliance configuration artifacts
- Audit-ready governance logs

---

## 4. Phase II — Technical Deployment & Sandbox (Days 31–60)

### Objectives
- Deploy sovereign instance
- Validate execution under governance
- Activate audit layer

### Deliverables
- Sovereign execution kernel deployed
- AI Guard & Auditor enabled
- Controlled identity issuance (≤10,000 records)
- Secure admin console

### Activities
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Identity lifecycle testing
- Governance approval workflows
- Incident simulation (non-destructive)

### Evidence Produced
- Deployment manifests
- AI audit logs
- Identity issuance reports
- Security & resilience assessment

---

## 5. Phase III — Evaluation & Readiness Assessment (Days 61–90)

### Objectives
- Assess readiness for national scale
- Produce IFI/UN-compatible reports
- Decide scale or pause

### Deliverables
- Pilot Evaluation Report
- Funding Readiness Package
- Scale Recommendation Memo
- Risk & Mitigation Register

### Activities
- Performance & governance review
- Legal and audit sign-off
- Cost & capacity modeling
- Optional regional alignment assessment

### Evidence Produced
- KPI & compliance dashboard
- Independent audit summary
- SDG alignment indicators
- Go / No-Go decision record

---

## 6. Success Criteria (Pilot Exit)

A pilot is considered **successful** if:

- ✔️ National law is enforced in code
- ✔️ Data never leaves jurisdiction
- ✔️ AI remains advisory only
- ✔️ Audit trail is complete
- ✔️ Governance decisions are traceable
- ✔️ No vendor lock-in exists

Scale is optional. **Sovereignty validation is mandatory.**

---

## 7. Risk Management

### Key Risks & Controls

| Risk | Control |
|-----|--------|
| Legal conflict | Constitutional pre-check |
| Data leakage | On-prem / air-gap option |
| AI overreach | AI Guard constraints |
| Political change | Constitution-first model |
| Vendor dependency | TESL + national ownership |

---

## 8. Funding & Oversight (Indicative)

- Pilot budget: **$1.5M – $3M**
- Funding type: Technical assistance / DPI grant
- Oversight: National audit + IFI observer (optional)
- Disbursement: Milestone-based

No funds are pooled or tokenized.

---

## 9. Post-Pilot Options

After Day 90, the adopting authority may choose:

1. **National Scale Deployment**
2. **Extended Pilot (sector-specific)**
3. **Pause with knowledge retention**
4. **Regional Hub coordination**

No automatic progression is assumed.

---

## 10. Final Statement

This pilot is a **sovereign proof**, not a product demo.

It demonstrates that a nation can:
> Own its digital identity,  
> Govern its digital rails,  
> And scale without surrendering authority.
