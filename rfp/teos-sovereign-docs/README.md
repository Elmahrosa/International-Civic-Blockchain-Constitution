Engagement with the TEOS Sovereign Stack follows a strict **Security Zone** model:

1.  **Constitutional Review**: All prospective partners must acknowledge the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution** as the sole canonical source of authority.
2.  **Rights Allocation**: Access is granted as **Sovereign Usage Rights**, not equity or ownership.
3.  **Capacity Caps**: Regional access is capped at **25%** to maintain global geopolitical balance.
