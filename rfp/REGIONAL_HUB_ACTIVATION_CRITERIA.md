## TEOS Sovereign Stack — Regional Hub Activation Framework

**Document Type:** Constitutional Gatekeeping Instrument
**Status:** Production
**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** January 2026

**Applies to:**
All multi-nation, regional, or supranational TEOS deployments
(e.g. AU, ASEAN, GCC, LATAM blocs, cross-border programs)

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory conditions** under which a **Regional Hub** may be activated within the TEOS Sovereign Stack.

Its objective is to ensure that regional coordination:

* Strengthens national sovereignty
* Does not dilute constitutional authority
* Prevents regional or institutional dominance
* Remains compliant with UN / IFI governance standards

---

## 2️⃣ Definition of a Regional Hub

A **Regional Hub** is a coordination layer that:

* Connects **two or more sovereign national deployments**
* Enables interoperability and policy alignment
* Does **not** replace national authority
* Does **not** act as a supranational governor

A Regional Hub is **coordination-only**, never a sovereign authority.

---

## 3️⃣ Non-Negotiable Principles

All Regional Hubs must comply with the following:

```
• National sovereignty is absolute
• Authority remains national
• Coordination does not equal control
• No supranational override
• No pooled sovereignty
• No regional data centralization
```

Any violation invalidates hub activation.

---

## 4️⃣ Minimum Activation Prerequisites (All Required)

A Regional Hub may only be activated when **all** of the following conditions are met:

### 🏛️ A. National Readiness

* Minimum **2 sovereign national pilots** completed with:

  * EXIT A or EXIT B status (per PILOT_EXIT_CRITERIA.md)
* Each nation has:

  * Active National Adapter Layer (NAL)
  * Confirmed data residency compliance
  * Signed Founding Nation or equivalent framework

---

### 📜 B. Constitutional Alignment

* All participating nations have:

  * Acknowledged the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**
  * Accepted **TESL** usage-rights framework
* No conflicting regional legal mandate exists that overrides national law

---

### ⚙️ C. Technical Interoperability

* Cross-border interoperability tested **without data pooling**
* Identity, payment, or civic flows remain jurisdiction-scoped
* Audit trails demonstrably separable per nation
* AI modules remain **decision-support only**

---

### 🤝 D. Institutional Governance

* Regional hub governance body (if any) is:

  * Administrative only
  * Non-executive
  * Non-binding
* No regional entity may:

  * Approve national policy
  * Enforce protocol changes
  * Control update cycles

---

## 5️⃣ Capacity & Power Limits

```
GLOBAL RULE:
No region may exceed 25% of total TEOS access capacity.
```

Additional rules:

* Capacity is **collective**, not per country
* Capacity does not imply ownership
* Capacity does not grant veto rights
* Unused capacity remains dormant

---

## 6️⃣ Prohibited Regional Behaviors

A Regional Hub **must not**:

✘ Centralize identity databases
✘ Pool biometric or sensitive data
✘ Act as procurement authority
✘ Negotiate on behalf of nations
✘ Introduce regional tokens or assets
✘ Override pilot exit decisions

Any attempt triggers **automatic suspension**.

---

## 7️⃣ Activation Decision Process

```
STEP 1: National Readiness Confirmation
STEP 2: Constitutional Compatibility Review
STEP 3: Capacity Availability Check
STEP 4: Founder Authority Approval
STEP 5: Formal Hub Activation Notice
```

No hub may be activated without **explicit Founder authorization**.

---

## 8️⃣ Suspension & Deactivation

A Regional Hub may be suspended or deactivated if:

* A participating nation withdraws
* Capacity caps are breached
* Governance violations occur
* Political misuse is detected
* UN / IFI compliance is compromised

Suspension does not affect national deployments.

---

## 9️⃣ Relationship to Other Instruments

This document operates in conjunction with:

* `DECISION-LOG.md`
* `AUTHORITY.md`
* `PILOT_EXIT_CRITERIA.md`
* `FOUNDING_NATION_MOU_SKELETON.md`
* `UN_SDG_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
