## TEOS Sovereign Stack — Pilot KPI & Audit Framework

**Ambitious DPI Metrics with Constitutional Safeguards**

**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** CANONICAL — PILOT PHASE
**Authority:** Office of the Founder — Elmahrosa International
**Governing Instruments:**

* International Civic Blockchain Constitution
* TESL (Teos Ethical Sovereign License)

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose & Scope

This document defines the **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**, **audit metrics**, and **funding milestone gates** for the **90-Day TEOS Sovereign Pilot**.

It is designed to:

* Satisfy **UN / IFI funding accountability**
* Enable **measurable DPI impact**
* Preserve **national sovereignty**
* Prevent **political or data-extraction risk**

> **Principle:** What is measured must never undermine sovereignty.

---

## 2️⃣ Measurement Philosophy (Critical)

TEOS metrics follow four non-negotiable rules:

1. **Outcome over Surveillance**
   → Measure system effectiveness, not citizen behavior.

2. **Aggregate before Individual**
   → No individual-level analytics exported.

3. **National Ownership of Data**
   → All raw data remains inside national infrastructure.

4. **Auditability without Centralization**
   → Evidence exists; control remains local.

## 6️⃣ Audit & Reporting Model

**Who Audits What:**

| Layer      | Auditor            | Access Level      |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Technical  | National authority | Full              |
| Governance | TEOS AI-Auditor    | Evidence-only     |

| Legal      | National counsel   | Full              |

**Exported to IFIs:**

* KPI summaries
* Compliance attestations
* Funding gate confirmations

**Never Exported:**

* Raw identity data
* Biometric material
* Internal policy debates

---

## 7️⃣ Risk Controls & Kill Switches

```
IF any of the following occur:
✘ Authority chain breach
✘ Unauthorized data access
✘ AI autonomy detected
✘ License violation

THEN:
→ Pilot pauses automatically
→ Funding freeze triggered
→ Constitutional review initiated
```

This protects **both the nation and the funder**.

---

## 8️⃣ Pilot Success Definition

A pilot is considered **successful** when:

* DPI functions under national law
* Institutions trust the system
* Citizens gain legal identity
* No sovereignty is surrendered
* Scale can occur without renegotiation

---

## 9️⃣ Closing Statement (For UN / IFI Records)

**TEOS demonstrates that Digital Public Infrastructure can be funded, audited, and scaled without extracting sovereignty or data.**

This framework enables **accountability without control transfer** — a prerequisite for ethical global digital development.
