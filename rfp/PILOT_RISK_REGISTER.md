## 2️⃣ Risk Classification Framework

All risks are evaluated across four dimensions:

| Dimension         | Definition                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Likelihood**    | Probability of occurrence during pilot              |
| **Impact**        | Sovereign, legal, financial, or reputational damage |
| **Detectability** | Ability to detect early via audit signals           |
| **Control Mode**  | Structural, Legal, Technical, or Procedural         |

Risk Levels:
🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | ⛔ Critical (Pilot-Stopping)

## 4️⃣ Risk Monitoring & Early Warning Signals

| Signal                   | Action                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Authority log anomaly    | Immediate constitutional review |
| Data access irregularity | Pilot pause                     |
| AI override attempt      | System halt                     |
| Funding leverage attempt | Legal escalation                |

Monitoring frequency: **Continuous (automated) + Weekly (human review)**

---

## 5️⃣ Escalation & Kill Switch Protocol

```
LEVEL 1 — ALERT
• Log anomaly detected
• Human review initiated

LEVEL 2 — CONTAINMENT
• Feature freeze
• Restricted access

LEVEL 3 — SUSPENSION
• Pilot paused
• Funding gate closed

LEVEL 4 — TERMINATION
• Constitutional breach confirmed
• Deployment revoked
```

Only **Founder Authority** may authorize restart.

---

## 6️⃣ Residual Risk Statement (For IFIs)

After mitigation, **residual risk** is assessed as:

* Governance: 🟡 Medium-Low
* Data Sovereignty: 🟢 Low
* Financial Exposure: 🟡 Medium
* Reputational Risk: 🟡 Medium

Residual risk is **acceptable** for pilot-phase DPI funding.

---

## 7️⃣ Pilot Risk Acceptance

By proceeding with the pilot, stakeholders acknowledge:

* Sovereignty takes precedence over speed
* Governance constraints are intentional
* Scale occurs **only after risk clearance**
