Its purpose is to ensure that regional coordination:

* Enhances interoperability
* Preserves national sovereignty

* A **non-sovereign structure**

A Regional Hub is **not**:

* A governing authority
* A procurement body
* A policy-making institution

---

## 3️⃣ Governance Principles

All Regional Hubs must operate under these principles:

```
• National authority is supreme
• Coordination ≠ control
• Participation is voluntary
• No binding regional mandates
• Transparency over centralization
```

---

A Regional Hub may include:

* **Coordination Secretariat** (administrative only)
* **Technical Working Groups** (advisory only)
* **Interoperability Forums** (knowledge-sharing)

All structures are:

* Non-binding
* Non-executive
* Time-limited

A Regional Hub **shall not**:

✘ Enforce national policy
✘ Approve or reject deployments
✘ Control protocol updates
✘ Pool national data
✘ Represent nations legally
✘ Negotiate funding on behalf of states

Any attempt constitutes a governance breach.

## 6️⃣ Decision-Making Limits

* Regional recommendations are **non-binding**
* National governments retain full veto
* Founder Authority retains constitutional override
* No voting mechanism may override national law

---

## 7️⃣ Oversight & Accountability
